 <b>Metological steps for each type of integral indicators of economic life in anthropospatial space Big Data</b>
 <br />
1) creation of dataset
- extraction and processing of spatial data from resources that allow to see in real time integral indicators of economic life in anthropospatial space.
- creation of a set of images on which these integral indicators will display , thanks to visualization tools on the maps or clustering (for example k-mean clustering) 
- creating pandas DataFrame with coordinates, and the main characteristics of these images
2) data correctness analysis
- creating mechanisms to determine the correctness of data, for example, by comparing results from several sources, comparing different parts of images, etc.
3) visualization of data analysis
- creation of interactive web page displaying the received data for the largest cities of Ukraine
4) species prediction
- prediction of the future view of images based on existing images in specific time-series, thanks to the application of linear regression neural networks to them
5) data visualization
- creating an interactive web page displaying previously defined spatial features
6) analysis of spatial features
- nuclear separation and peripheralization
- determination of growth and decline poles
- spatial trendsetting
- downsizing heatmaps
7) visualization of spatial features
- creating an interactive web page displaying previously defined spatial features
8) subtracting voronasichennya
- calculation for each pixel of the value of coverage of integral indicators of economic life in anthropospatial space by a certain zone around it
9) forecast of space saturation
- prediction of the future type of space saturation images on the basis of existing images in specific time-series, thanks to the application of linear regression neural networks to them
10) visualization space saturation
- creating an interactive web page showing the saturation defined earlier
